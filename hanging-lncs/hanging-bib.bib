abstract="Any attempt to characterize formally the set of sentences which a given person X knows to be true probably requires a certain amount of idealization. For the fact that he knows A to be true and knows B to be true can, one hopes, be determined by some kind of empirical investigation. If so, these facts are stubborn and irreducible, and X may know A but not B despite the fact that in some proposed formal system, A implies B. Still, it may be argued that X can be persuaded of B, given that he knows A, without informing him of any new contingent truths. For example, B may simply be a logical consequence of A, or it may follow, given certain other assumptions about knowledge which are held to be true of rational knowers.",

Coq's capabilities are used to implement modal logics in a minimalistic manner, which is nevertheless sufficient for the formalization of significant, non-trivial modal logic proofs. The elegance, flexibility and convenience of this approach, from a user perspective, are illustrated here with the successful formalization of G{\"o}del's ontological argument.",
